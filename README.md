- Hi! I’m @Ludovica-De-Mare.
- On this page you'll find my Physics Bachelor Research Project (final version of my thesis + Python code used).
- I attended Groningen University and I did my bachelor thesis at the Van Swinderen Institute for Particel Physics and Gravity.
- Data used: CERN, LHC run 2 data.
- Since data cannot be shared, hence the code cannot be runned, the output of each relevant snippet is shown with pictures.
