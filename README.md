- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ludovica-De-Mare
- Iâ€™m interested in physics and economics; 
- âœ¨ On this profile you'll find my Physics Bachelor Research Project (final version of my thesis + Python code used).
- I attended Groningen University and I did my bachelor thesis at the Van Swinderen Institute for Particel Physics and Gravity.
- The data used for this project is CERN, LHC run 2 data which is CERN property, hence not included in the code obviously!
